                Daniel is a British bloke who works with Skyscanner and LonelyPlanet on the regular.<br>

                He’s an amazing writer with tons of useful tips, and is an even better photographer. I had the privilege of traveling with Daniel and working with him in India. There was never a dull moment!<br>

                His photography has also been published in Beautiful Destination, Travel & Leisure, National Geographic, Travel Channel and Matador Network..
